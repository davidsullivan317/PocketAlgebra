<b>Expression List Editor Help </b>
<br/>
<br/>
The <i>Expression List Editor</i> is used to manipulate multiple expressions together. An expression list can contain a maximum of 15 expressions.
<br/>
<br/>
Expressions, and subexpressions, may be selected using the approach demonstrated in the tutorial. Selected expressions will appear in blue in <i>Expression List Editor</i> while selected expressions will appear in red in the <i>Expression Editor</i>. 
<br/>
<br/>
<b>The Expression List Toobar</b>
<br/>
<br/>
At the top-center of the <i>Expression List Editor </i> is the set of tools used to manipulate the current list of expressions. From left to right they are:
<br/>
<ol>
<li>Choose Expression (page button) - Choose an expression from a list or select a new list of expressions.</li>
<li>Enter Expression ("+" button) - Add a new expression using the <i>Expression Input Screen.</i></li>
<li>Edit Expression (pencil button) - Edit the selected expression.</li>
<li>Save Expression List (disk button) - Save the list of expressions.</li>
<li>Delete Expression (delete button) - Delete the selected expression or all expression in the list.</li>
</ol>
These tools are described in detail below.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Choose Expression</b>
<br/>
<br/>
To use <i>Choose Expression,</i> touch the <i>Choose Expression </i>button to see the table of saved expression lists. Navigate to the desired expression and select it. The chosen expression will be added to the current expression list. 
<br/>
<br/>
Expression lists you have saved will appear in the <i>My Expression Lists</i> table entry. 
<br/>
<br/>
The expression lists in <i>My Expression Lists</i> table entry may be edited.
<br/>
<br/>
Touch the "All" table entry in an expression list to load all expressions in that list into the  <i>Expression List Editor</i>. Note that your current list of expressions will be replaced, so make sure you save your list, if desired, before using this option.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Enter Expression</b>
<br/>
<br/>
To use <i>Enter Expression</i>, touch the <i>Enter Expression </i>button, enter your expression in the <i>Expression Input Screen</i> and touch the <i>Done </i>button. The entered expression will be added to the current expression list. 
<br/>
<br/>
Refer to the help text on the <i>Expression Editor </i>screen for help with using the expression editor. You access the help text by pressing the (i) button in the upper righthand corner of the <i>Expression Editor </i>screen.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Edit Expression</b>
<br/>
<br/>
If an expression, or subexpression, in your list is selected the <i>Edit Expression</i> button will be active. Touch the <i>Edit Expression</i> button to load the selected expression into the <i>Expression Editor</i>.  When you are finished editing, the selected expression will be replaced with the new one.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Save Expression List</b>
<br/>
<br/>
Touch the <i>Save Expression List</i> button to save the current list of expressions. Enter a name for your expression list and press the "Done" button in the keyboard. Your expression list will appear in the <i>My Expression Lists</i> table entry of the  <i>Choose Expression</i> tool. 
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Delete Expression</b>
<br/>
<br/>
If an expression, or subexpression, in your list is selected, touch the <i>Delete Expression</i> button to delete the expression. You will be prompted to confirm the deletion. To delete all expressions in the list, touch the <i>Delete Expression</i> button with no expression selected and confirm the deletion.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Substitutions</b>
<br/>
<br/>
If your expression list has one or more equations, you can substitute the left or right side of the equation into any subexpression in your expression list that is symbolically equivalent. For example, if your expression list contains:
<br/>
<ol>
<li>y = 4*x - 3</li>
<li>x = 3 - c</li>
</ol>
<br/>
You can replace the x in the first equation with 3 - c from the second. To do so, select the x in the second equation (the left side of the equation) and then the x in the first. The x in the first equation will be replaced with 3 - c (y = 4*(3 - c) - 3).
<br/>
<br/>
Here are a couple of ideas for using substitution. 
<br/>
<br/>
1) Solve the following system of equations:
<ol>
<li>Solve for x and y</li>
<li>y = 4*x - 3</li>
<li>y = 3 - x</li>
</ol>
Select the y in the second equation and then the y in the first equation. The first equation will become 3 - x = 4*x - 3. Solve for x. Your equation list is now:
<br/>
<ol>
<li>x = 6/5</li>
<li>y = 3 - x</li>
</ol>
Select the x in the first equation and then the x in the second equation. The second equation will become y = 3 - 6/5. Now solve for y. Your equation list is now:
<ol>
<li>x = 6/5</li>
<li>y = 9/5</li>
</ol>
2) Evaluate a function for a given value of x:
<ol>
<li>y = 4*x - 3</li>
<li>x = 2</li>
</ol>
Select the x in the second equation and then the x in the first equation. The first equation will become y = 4*2 - 3. Solve for y (y = 5), which is your answer.
