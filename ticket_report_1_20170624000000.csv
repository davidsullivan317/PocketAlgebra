I find lots of the buttons to be very small and suggest using more of the whitespace under the onscreen keyboard.  The qwerty layout takes up valuable space, and is most certainly not going to work for other languages, if that is something you need/want to worry about.  I'd suggest limiting the alpha keys to the standard x, y, and z (which you have above the numbers, so then you could drop qwerty).  But, if you wanted all alpha keys, then you could lay them out in some alphabetical format, freeing up much-needed space to make the numeric keys a bit bigger. - I keep making mistakes when entering expressions which is fine and to be expected, but I get frustrated that I have to hit backspace because there is no cursor during editing to position at the problem area to insert a new character or delete an extraneous char.","","0.0","0.0","0.00","58","2","Production launch","58","3","1","Pocket Algebra 1.0","1","David S.","","","","<none>","Accepted","Expression entry needs to be more user friendly","2013-09-28T10:51:56Z","","<none>","","<none>","","<none>","","<none>"
