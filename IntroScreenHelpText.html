Here's a quick overview of Pocket Algebra.
<br/>
<br/>
<b> Enter Expression </b>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>Enter Expression</i> provides a way to quickly enter a single expression for evaluation. Use this feature when you don't need to save the expression or evaluate it in conjunction with other expressions.
<br/>
<br/>
To use <i>Enter expression, </i>touch the <i>Enter Expression </i>button, enter your expression in the <i>Expression Input Screen</i> and touch the <i>Done </i>button. Your expression will be loaded into the <i>Expression Editor </i>for evaluation.
<br/>
<br/>
Refer to the help text on the <i>Expression Editor </i>screen for help with using the expression editor. You access the help text by pressing the (i) button in the upper righthand corner of the <i>Expression Editor </i>screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Touch the back (<i>Pocket Algebra</i>) button to return to the main screen. Note that your work will not be saved.
<br/>
<br/>
<b> Choose Expression </b>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>Choose Expression</i> provides a way to pick a saved expression for evaluation. Use this feature to select one of your saved expressions or one of the expressions provided with Pocket Algebra.
<br/>
<br/>
To use <i>Choose Expression, </i>touch the <i>Choose Expression </i>button to see the table of saved expression lists. Navigate to the desired expression and select it. Expression lists you have saved will appear in the <i>My Expression Lists </i>table entry. The chosen expression will be loaded into the <i>Expression Editor </i>for evaluation.
<br/>
<br/>
You will not have the option to select all expressions in a list when using the <i>Choose Expression</i> option from the main screen. Refer to the Expression List help for more information on selecting all expressions in a list. 
<br/>
<br/>
The expression lists in <i>My Expression Lists</i> table entry may be edited.
<br/>
<br/>
Refer to the help text on the <i>Expression Editor</i> screen for help with using the expression editor. You access the help text by pressing the (i) button in the upper righthand corner of the <i>Expression Editor</i> screen.  
<br/>
<br/>
Touch the back (<i>Pocket Algebra</i>)  button to return to the main screen. Note that your work will not be saved.
<br/>
<br/>
<b> Expression List </b>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>Expression List</i> provides a way to evaluate multiple expressions in context of one another. Refer to the help text on the <i>Expression List</i> screen for further details. You access the help text by pressing the (i) button in the upper righthand corner of the <i>Expression List</i> screen.  
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Tutorial</b>
<br/>
<br/>
Use the <i>Tutorial</i> to learn how to manipulate your expressions. Touch the <i>Tutorial</i> button to see the Tutorial Chapters table and choose a chapter. Use the left and right arrows to move from step to step within a tutorial chapter. Note that the tutorial will continue with the next chapter when you reach the end of the previous chapter. 
<br/>
<br/>
Touch the back (<i>Pocket Algebra</i>)  button on the <i>Tutorial Chapters</i> screen to return to the main screen.
<br/>
<br/>
When in the tutorial touch the Touch the back (Tutorial Chapters)  button to return to the <i>Tutorial Chapters</i> screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Plan to return to the tutorial often as you become familiar with Pocket Algebra.  There is a lot to learn and you probably won't use all of the features when you first start.

<b>A Note to Students</b>
<br/>
<br/>
Pocket Algebra was created to help you learn algebra. It will not teach you algebra - it assumes you are in a class or using an algebra textbook to learn. But, if properly used, it can take some of the pain out of the learning experience (assuming you're not already acing your tests, in which case Pocket Algebra will be more for fun!). 
<br/>
<br/>
Warning! It's possible to use Pocket Algebra to solve reasonably complex equations and problems and learn nothing. Here is are a couple of suggestions for using Pocket Algebra to improve you test scores:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>Check you work. Solve a homework problem yourself and then check your work by solving the same problem in Pocket Algebra. If you were wrong you should be able to see where you went wrong. Make of mental note of the mistake and try the problem again (without Pocket Algebra) until you get it right. </li>
<br/>
<li>Repetition. Repetition. Repetition. Create lists of homework problems and repeatedly solve them using Pocket Algebra until they are second nature to you. Hopefully, Pocket Algebra can help make this process easier and a bit more fun.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
If you can use Pocket Algebra effectively to solve algebra problems it should be a short step to being able to do so without it. Make sure you take that last step!

Pocket Algebra was envisioned, designed, agonized over, and cobbled together by David Sullivan. It has been a labor of love for longer than I care to admit. I hope you have as much fun using it as I did coding it.
