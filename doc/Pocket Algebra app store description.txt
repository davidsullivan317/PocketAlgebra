Pocket Algebra is a full-featured application for students learning algebra. Simply touch the symbols in an expression to simplify and solve algebraic problems. 

Pocket Algebra includes a powerful expression editor, where you do your "number crunching." A robust tutorial walks you through everything you need to know to get started. A history of previous steps is available in the editor so you can review or back up to a previous step at any time.

Algebraic features supported include:

1) Integer arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

2) Exponentials and radicals (i.e. squared and square root).

3) Manipulating equations - add, subtract, divide and multiply both sides of an equation.

4) Any number of variables or constants.

5) Distribution and factorization. 

6) Expression substitution and systems of equations.

Use a calculator-like interface to enter your homework problems. 

You can create and save custom lists of expressions to practice with at any time. Pocket Algebra also includes sample problems that are ready to work.
